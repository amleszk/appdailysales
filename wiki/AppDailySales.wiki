#summary Python script to download daily sales reports from iTunes Connect web site.

= Introduction =

AppDailySales is a Python script that will download yesterday's daily sales report from the iTunes Connect web site.  

= How to Use =

Download the script appdailysales.py and run the command line:

  * *python appdailysales.py*


{{{
usage: appdailysales.py [options]
Options and arguments:
-h     : print this help message and exit (also --help)
-a uid : your apple id (also --appleId)
-p pwd : your password (also --password)
-o dir : directory where download file is stored, default is the current working directory (also --outputDirectory)
-v     : verbose output (also --verbose)
-u     : unzip download fipe (also --unzip)
}}}

You can also change the option variables located towards the top of the script file if you prefer to not use the command line options. However, this approach is not recommended with version 1.2 and greater of the script file.

= Some Final Words =

I created this script with the iPhone developer in mind.  Being an iPhone developer myself I don't want to remember to download the daily sales report from yesterday's activity so I wrote this script.  I have a cron job scheduled on a server that will download each day's report for me so I don't have to.  Ain't automation great.

It's my first attempt at writing a Python program (script) so be kind.  I'm sure there are better ways to accomplish what this script does and as I learn more about Python I will try to incorporate the better approaches into the script.
