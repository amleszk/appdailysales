#summary Python script to download daily sales reports from iTunes Connect web site.

= Introduction =

AppDailySales is a Python script that will download yesterday's daily sales report from the iTunes Connect web site.  

= How to Use =

Download the script appdailysales.py and run the command line:

  * *python appdailysales.py*

Be sure to change the appleId and password variable values to your Apple ID and Password.  Without valid credentials the daily report cannot be downloaded. 

= Some Final Words =

I created this script with the iPhone developer in mind.  Being an iPhone developer myself I don't want to remember to download the daily sales report from yesterday's activity so I wrote this script.  I have a cron job scheduled on a server that will download each day's report for me so I don't have to.  Ain't automation great.

It's my first attempt at writing a Python program (script) so be kind.  I'm sure there are better ways to accomplish what this script does and as I learn more about Python I will try to incorporate the better approaches into the script.
