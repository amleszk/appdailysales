# iTune Connect Daily Sales Reports Downloader
# Copyright 2008 Kirby Turner
#
#
# This script will download yesterday's daily sales report from
# the iTunes Connect web site.  The downloaded file is stored
# in the same directory containing the script file.  Note: if
# the download file already exists then it will be overwritten.
#
# The iTunes Connect web site has dynamic urls and form field
# names.  In other words, these values change from session to
# session.  So to get to the download file we must navigate  
# the site and webscrape the pages.  Joy, joy.
